    - Logout button now always visible at bottom without scrolling
    - No more glitches when scrolling sidebar navigation
    - Better UX with logout always accessible
    - Sidebar structure: header (fixed top) -> nav (scrollable) -> footer (fixed bottom)
    
    Resolves: Sidebar scrolling glitch and logout button visibility delay

    fix: Resolve dashboard bottom content not visible on mobile
    
    Root cause fixes:
    - Remove overflow: hidden from body element that was preventing scrolling
    - Remove max-height: 100vh from .dashboard-main to allow content expansion
    - Remove overflow: hidden from .dashboard-main container
    - Change height to min-height on .dashboard-content for all viewports
    
    Changes made:
    - body: removed overflow: hidden (was blocking all scrolling)
    - .dashboard-main: removed max-height and overflow restrictions
    - .dashboard-content: use min-height instead of fixed height
    - Added padding-bottom: 3rem (desktop), 2.5rem (mobile) for spacing
    
    Result:
    - Dashboard now scrolls exactly like index.jsp (public pages)
    - All bottom content fully visible and accessible on mobile
    - Users can scroll to the very end of content on all devices
    - Maintains sidebar fixed layout while content area scrolls freely
    
    Resolves: Dashboard bottom content cut off on mobile devices
